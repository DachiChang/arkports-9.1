Compton is a compositor for X, and a fork of xcompmgr-dana.

I was frustrated by the low amount of standalone lightweight compositors. 
Compton was forked from Dana Jansens' fork of xcompmgr and refactored. 
I fixed whatever bug I found, and added features I wanted. 
Things seem stable, but don't quote me on it. 
I will most likely be actively working on this until I get the features I want.
This is also a learning experience for me. 
That is, I'm partially doing this out of a desire to learn Xlib.
